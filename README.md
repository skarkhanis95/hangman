## with Basic Python
### Thanks to [London App Brewery](https://www.londonappbrewery.com/) for this wonderful course on Python!

Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses

Here Computer is the second player who would be thinking of words in his mind and you get a channce to choose correct word!

## Features

- You get 6 lives! So you can choose incorrectly 6 times only!
